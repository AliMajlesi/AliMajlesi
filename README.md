<h1 align="center">Hi there, I'm Ali Majlesi 👋</h1>

### Who Am I?
Ali is like a superhero 🦸‍♂️ but instead of fighting crime, he fights bugs 🐛 as a software engineer. He's so good at debugging 💻

But he's not just all code and no humor 😂, he knows that sharing his mistakes and experiences can help others and make the world a better place, one line of code at a time 👨‍💻. So if you need someone to debug your life, Ali is the guy! 🤘
